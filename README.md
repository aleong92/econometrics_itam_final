# Econometrics Workshop II
## ITAM

This repo is the final project of the course. **The goal is to succesfully extract data from INEGI's API and aggregate it into a single, usable dataframe.**

You'll basically find the following files:

* `requirements.txt` in case you want to clone and replicate the code.
* `gitignore` to sotre and update only relevant files.
* Python script to extract data and create a dataframe.
